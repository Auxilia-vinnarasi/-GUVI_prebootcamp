<!--
alert("I'm JavaScript!");
alert('Hello') // this line is not having semicolon

1>JavaScript semicolons are optional.This is all possible because JavaScript does not strictly require semicolons.
 When there is a place where a semicolon was needed, it adds it behind the scenes.

alert(`Wor
 ld`)
alert(3 +
    1 +
    2); // this is multiple line code and its working
    
1>Earlier, multi-line string was not supported by JavaScript.
After 2015, string literals have introduced by ES that supports multi-line string.
2>single or double quotes for the strings and concatenate them using the + sign.
3>alert('3'+"1"+"2")means we will get 312 as answer so for a number we got 6 as answer.
