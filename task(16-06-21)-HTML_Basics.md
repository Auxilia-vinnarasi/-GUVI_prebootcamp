**Difference between <div>, <article>, <section> tag**
  Tags are introduced to bring semantic meaning to a webpage.
  <div>:
   --> The <div> tag defines a division or section in an HTML document.It is used to group block elements to format them with CSS.
   --> <div> has only a generic, non-specific meaning and no semantic purpose.
   --> When no other element is suitable, the div element is used as an element of last resort. Otherwise, it leads to poor accessibility for reader.
   
  <section>:
   --> <section> means that content inside is grouped.It defines section in a document,such as chapters,headers,footers or anyother sections of the document.
   --> <section> gathers a specific and strong semantic purpose.
   --> A Web siteâ€™s home page could be split into sections for an introduction, news items, and contact information.
   --> A section can have nested sections.
     
  <article>:
    --> An article tag is used to provide articulated data in a big paragraph.
    --> Article tag specifies independent, self-contained content.
    --> An article can have nested articles and that should refer to parent article.
    --> Article tags are perfect for Microdata information.
    --> Article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.
